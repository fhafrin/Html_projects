      <h1>Kacchi</h1>
      <p>Kacchi Biryani is a rich and aromatic dish popular in Bangladesh, made with marinated mutton, fragrant basmati rice, and a blend of traditional spices. Unlike regular biryani, the raw marinated meat is layered with rice and slow-cooked on dum (steam) for hours, allowing the flavors to meld perfectly. It is often garnished with fried onions, saffron-infused milk, and boiled potatoes, making it a festive favorite at weddings and special occasions. Served with salad and borhani, Kacchi Biryani is a true indulgence for biryani lovers.</p>

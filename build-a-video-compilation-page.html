    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <p>Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications that run in a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.). It involves both the frontend (what users see and interact with) and the backend (server-side logic, databases, etc.).</p>

        <h2>Front End Development</h2>
        <p>Frontend development is the part of web development that focuses on what users see and interact with on a website or web application. It’s all about designing and building the user interface (UI) — the layout, buttons, forms, animations, and overall look and feel.</p>

        <h2>Backend Development</h2>
        <p>Backend development is the part of web development that works behind the scenes — it's responsible for how a website functions, including databases, server logic, authentication, payments, and more.</p>

        <h2>Full Stack Development</h2>
        <p>Full stack development means working on both the frontend and the backend of a web application. A Full Stack Developer is someone who can build entire web apps from start to finish — from designing the user interface (UI) to writing the backend logic and managing the database.</p>
